# Rust Todo list 

This is a simple project to help me practice the core fundamentals of rust. 
The main objective is to build a CLI that will allow the user to Create, Read, Update and Delete todo list items. 

Below exists a Markdown Todo List of features I want to implement in this project. 

## Project Todo list 

- [ ] Print Menu 
- [ ] Allow numerical selection of menu actions 
- [ ] View List of todos 
- [ ] Create a Todo 
- [ ] Read a Todo 
- [ ] Delete a Todo 
- [ ] Update a Todo 
- [ ] Mark a Todo as completed 
- [ ] View the completion status in the list which you view todos 
- [ ] Write TODOs to a file 
- [ ] Read TODOs from a file 
- [ ] Add A DB connection and pull TODOs 
- [ ] Add a DB connection and push TODOs 
- [ ] Handle Validation and Errors that may occur due to human input 
- [ ] Add Modularity to the program so not everything is in the main file
